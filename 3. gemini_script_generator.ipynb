      "\n",
      "**Scene:** A bustling city street, lightly dusted with snow. A chic woman navigates the urban landscape, a backdrop of modern architecture and quirky street art. A playful penguin animation occasionally pops up on building screens, contrasting the urban vibe.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Characters:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   AVA: (20s-30s) Stylish and confident.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Visual Cues/Action:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **(0:00-0:02)** Opening shot: Ava walks confidently down the street. Focus on her feet, showcasing stylish cap-toe low-heel ankle boots. Quick cuts to buildings with animated penguins on their screens.\n",
      "*   **(0:02-0:04)** Camera pans up, showcasing her full outfit: a warm, urban-style coat and stylish accessories. She pauses briefly, looking into a store window.\n",
      "*   **(0:04-0:06)** Close-up shot of her boots again, highlighting the cap-toe detail. Subtle shimmer effect added to represent the crystal detail similar to the Cap-Toe Crystal Mary Jane.\n",
      "*   **(0:06-0:08)** Ava continues walking, now with a slight skip in her step. She bites into a crisp red apple. Final shot shows her disappearing into the urban crowd.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Dialogue/Voiceover:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **(0:00-0:02) Voiceover (Warm, upbeat tone):** \"Winter in the city... demands style and comfort.\"\n",

      "**Sound:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **(0:00-0:02)** Upbeat, modern music begins.\n",
      "*   **(0:02-0:04)** Music softens slightly, becomes more atmospheric.\n",
      "*   **(0:04-0:06)** Sound of crunching snow underfoot.\n",
      "*   **(0:06-0:08)** Music swells again, ends on a positive note. Sound of an apple bite.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Notes:**\n",
